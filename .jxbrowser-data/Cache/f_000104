	<div class="card-content">
	  <h4>Congratulations on choosing the SimpleLink&trade; CC1352R wireless MCU and LaunchPad&trade; development ecosystem!</h4>
	  <p>
	    The CC1352R LaunchPad&trade; (<a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/launchxl-cc1352r1">LAUNCHXL-CC1352R1</a>) is a
	    dual-band low power radio kit utilizing the <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/cc1352r">CC1352R</a> which
	    enables Sub-1&nbsp;GHz + 2.4 GHz in a single chip solution. The CC1352R LaunchPad enables development of
	    wireless applications for the SimpleLink CC1352R wireless MCU supporting proprietary Sub-1&nbsp;GHz,
	    TI&nbsp;15.4-Stack for IEEE&nbsp;802.15.4e/g star based networking (868&nbsp;MHz, 915&nbsp;MHz and
	    2.4&nbsp;GHz) and Bluetooth low energy (BLE).  With multiprotocol support, the CC1352R can run
	    Sub-1&nbsp;GHz and 2.4&nbsp;GHz protocols concurrently, including, TI 15.4-Stack, Proprietary Sub-1 GHz, and
	    BLE.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The CC13x2 family of wireless MCUs contain a 32-bit ARM&reg; Cortex&reg;-M4F processor running at
	    48&nbsp;MHz as the main application processor, 352&nbsp;kB of in-system programmable flash memory,
	    80&nbsp;kB of low-leakage SRAM, a full complement of peripherals such as I2C, SPI and UART, advanced
	    cryptography accelerators (ECC, AES256, SHA256, etc.) as well as a Sensor Controller Engine (SCE). The SCE
	    is a 2nd programmable processor core ideal for ultra low-power sensor reading and data processing
	    applications. The SCE runs independently from the main Cortex-M4F and handles sensor polling using just a
	    few micro amps of average current. A dedicated Radio Controller (ARM Cortex-M0) handles low-level RF and
	    physical layer (PHY) protocol commands that are stored in ROM or RAM, thus ensuring ultra-low power and
	    great flexibility. A comprehensive list of capabilities can be found in the device data sheet and Technical
	    Reference Manual
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The CC1352R LaunchPad kit is supported by the SimpleLink Starter app for iOS and Android. This app connects
	    your LaunchPad to a smartphone using BLE and supports reading the LaunchPad button states, controlling LEDs
	    and send strings of data to the UART backchannel. It also supports cloud connectivity to the IBM Quickstart
	    server or to any cloud service via MQTT. This enables a cloud view where you can control your LaunchPad from
	    any web browser in minutes after setting it up. Development with the CC1352R LaunchPad is supported by the
	    <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/simplelink-cc13x2-sdk">SimpleLink CC13x2 SDK</a> containing protocol stack
	    and sample application as well as a wide-range of free development tools such
	    as <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO">Code Composer Studio&trade;</a> (CCS)
	    v7, <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/SMARTRFTM-STUDIO">SmartRF&trade; Studio</a>
	    and <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/SENSOR-CONTROLLER-STUDIO">Sensor Controller Studio</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The CC1352R LaunchPad kit can also be upgraded to the latest firmware version or programmed with other
	    wireless protocol demonstration firmware with the over-the-air download (OAD) capability in the SimpleLink
	    Starter app, or programmed directly over USB from a PC using
	    the <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH">Uniflash</a> flash programming tool.

	  <h4>Power supply requirements:</h4>
	  <p>The LaunchPad is designed to be powered from a USB-compliant power source, either a USB charger or a
	    computer. When used this way, jumpers need to be mounted on the 3V3 position of the central jumper block. An
	    LDO powered from the USB VBUS supply supplies 3.3&nbsp;V to the XDS110 debugger, the CC1352R, and
	    associated circuitry including the 3V3-marked pins for BoosterPacks.</p>

	  <h4>Temperature range:</h4>	  
	  <p>The LaunchPad development kit is designed for operation from -25&deg;C to +70&deg;C. Note that other
	    BoosterPack accessories and LaunchPads may have different temperature ranges, and when combined, the
	    combination will be set by the most restrictive combined range. Also, if powering the LaunchPad from an
	    external battery, ensure that you do not exceed the specified operating temperature of the battery.
	  </p>

	  <h4>Good to know</h4>
	  <p>
	    <ul>

	      <li>
		The RF switch used on the LAUNCHXL-CC1352R1 EVM consumes approximately 1.5&nbsp;uA which must be accounted
		for when doing power measurements. An alternative implementation where the switch is powered from an IO
		will remove this added current consumption.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Out of box, jumpers for the TDO, TDI, SWO and GND signals on the XDS110 jumper block are not mounted and
		cJTAG is being used for flashing &amp; debugging. This gives users access to DIO16 and DIO17. If
		four-pin JTAG is required, simply uninstall the resistors labeled DIO16 and DIO17 and install jumpers on
		the XDS110 jumper block. For the GND pins, a jumper is not necessarily as the ground for XDS110 and
		CC1352R is connected on the PCB. 
	      </li>
	      <li>
		The CC1352R LaunchPad is equipped with on-board EnergyTrace&trade; measurement circuitry. The current
		implementation is not working as expected, the noise levels are too high to do meaningful
		measurements. The problem can be somewhat mitigated by powering the CC1352R from an external power
		supply (such as a lab bench supply). An update to the ET circuitry which will resolve this issue is
		planned for a future version of the LaunchPad.
	      </li>	      
	      <li>
		Please note that the CC1352R LaunchPads are for early evaluation only and are built with pre-RTM CC1352R
		silicon. Software compatibility after newer or updated silicon is released is not guaranteed. At this
		time, the development kit must be replaced with the new revision. A discount for the new revision of the
		LAUNCHXL-CC1352R1 will be available to customers who purchased the early evaluation version.

	  <h4>Using the LaunchPad to Debug &amp; Program External Devices</h4>
	  <p>
	    The jumper block in the middle of the board can be used to disconnect the upper section (XDS110 debugger)
	    from the lower section containing the wireless MCU (CC1352R). The jumpers are mounted by default. Which
	    enables the CC1352R to be programmed and debugged by the XDS110.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The onboard XDS110 can be used to debug and program external MCU targets supported by the XDS110 debugger,
	    such as CC13xx and CC26xx wireless MCUs. It is also possible to connect compatible external debuggers to the
	    onboard CC1352R. In either case, all the jumpers on the jumper block must be removed.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    With all the jumper block jumpers removed, the XDS110 Out header will work as debug output for the XDS110,
	    and the Target In header will work as debug connector for the CC1352R. The XDS110 output is level shifted
	    and support target voltages between 1.8&nbsp;V and 3.6&nbsp;V. If the target board is powered externally,
	    the VSENSE jumper must removed. Alternatively, the target can be powered by the LaunchPad through the debug
	    header (connecting the Vsense pin to the LaunchPad 3.3&nbsp;V supply), in this case the VSENSE jumper must
	    be placed in the XDS110 Power position (the default position).
	  </p>

	  <h4>Running the CC1352R from External Power</h4>
	  <p>
	    The CC1352R is by default powered from the LaunchPad's 3.3&nbsp;V LDO. It is possible to run the device off
	    different supply voltages by disconnecting the 3.3&nbsp;V jumper and connecting a power supply between
	    1.8&nbsp;V and 3.6&nbsp;V to any of the pins marked 3V3. In this case the VSENSE jumper must be placed in
	    the Extern Pwr position to connect the external supply to the XDS110 level shifters. Note that even though
	    the supply voltage range of the CC1352R is up to 3.8&nbsp;V, the maximum voltage in this case is limited by
	    the level shifters at 3.6&nbsp;V. When measuring current consumption, ensure that the serial (SPI) flash
	    memory is placed into low power mode. Support for placing the serial flash into low power mode is provided
	    in the LaunchPad board file included with the SimpleLink CC13x2 SDK.

	    2402&nbsp;MHz to 2480&nbsp;MHz at +5&nbsp;dBm Tx Power setting. Should you choose to configure the EUT to
	    operate outside of the test conditions, it should be operated inside a protected and controlled environment
	    (such as, a shielded chamber).  This evaluation board is only for development and not an end
	    product. Developers and integrators that incorporate the chipset in any end products are responsible for
	    obtaining applicable regulatory approvals for such end product.
